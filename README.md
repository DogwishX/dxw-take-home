### User stories:
- [ ] When the user first loads the application, they are presented with a free text search
box
- [ ] When they search for an acronym, the application displays the full organisation
name for that acronym if one exists
- [ ] If no such acronym exists, an appropriate message is displayed
- [ ] An autocomplete is available on the search box, so that as a user begins to type
acronyms that match the letters they entered are presented in a dropdown

both “DCMS” and “DCLG”)
